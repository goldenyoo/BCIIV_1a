There was no collaboration. I doen it by myself.

Is it possible for StrCopy to call assert to verify that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough? Explain.
- StrCopy gets information only from the parameters pcDest and pcSrc. pcDest is just a pointer points the location of the destination memeory area. Therefore, StrCopy has no way to assert whether memory is large enough or not.
